# Logistic Regression Model
    #After testing the two models head to head, it's clear that logistic regression presents a higher level of accuracy.

#Random Forest Classifier:
    #When we compare both training and testing scores, it becomes clear that there is not a significant difference between the two models.

#There wasn't a significant difference between the two training models, but it is clear Logistic Regression Model peformed better than the Random Forest Classifier
